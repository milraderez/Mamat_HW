1. we would assume about 1 minute pre page, for seaching both Midfielder and 
   midfielder, counting and inserting to the file, for a total of 25 min.
   
2. we came to the conclusion that writing a bash script might take a while, 
   but can save a lot of time when its ready to run independently.
   
   it can be applied to every need for counting and collecting data, such
   as picking focus groups for health studies, costumer care, and reviewing 
   social media opinions about a topic.

3. it would only be needed to re run the script, as the script already deletes
   his temporary files
   to perform it automatically every hour, we would need to assign the computer
   clock to the script, and run it by condition.
   in order to save runtime, we would keep the temp_result file, and then we
   would only need to go through the players that aren't showed there, as we 
   assume that every player that was checked before, wont change his
   position in the future.
